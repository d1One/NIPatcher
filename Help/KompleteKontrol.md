# Komple Kontrol patches:

## Window Size
Self explanatory, changes the window height size in pixels.<br>
<br>
`With Plugin`: Changes the height of the KK window when there is a Plugin loaded.<br>
`Without Plugin`: Changes the height of the KK window when there no a Plugin loaded, if this value is bigger than "With Plugin" then the window will always use the value set here. I recommend setting both to the same size.<br>

Note - I advise keeping the relationship of originals values, meanign that if you inscrease the value of With Plugin by 300 pixels then also add 300 pixels in the Without Plugin box.<br>

## Fonts
Self explanatory, changes Font sizes.<br>
<br>
`Butttos`: Tags, File Stab, Scale/Arp buttons, MIDI Learn Knobs/Buttons, +<br>
`Labels`: Preset result list, main MIDI learn button, +<br>


Note - Incresing the font too much without also increasing the deault height the GUI window can result in not being able to have both Types and Character expanded at the same time in the Browser<br>

## Wide Browser
A colletion of several small mods that makes the browser wider enought to allow rows of 4 product thumbnails. (add credit later)
