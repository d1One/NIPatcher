Born out of the discust for the fixed window size and tiny fonts in Komplete Kontrol ðŸ˜‚

### Feature list:
- [x] Change GUI height size<br>
- [x] Increase browser width<br>
- [x] Change font sizes<br>

## Window Size
Self explanatory, changes the window height size in pixels.<br>
<br>
`With Plugin`: Changes the height of the KK window when there is a Plugin loaded.<br>
`Without Plugin`: Changes the height of the KK window when there no a Plugin loaded, if this value is bigger than `With Plugin` then the window will always use the value set here.<br>

- Note - I advise keeping the relationship of originals values, meaning that if you increase the pixel value of `With Plugin` by 300 pixels then also add 300 pixels in the `Without Plugin` option.<br>

## Fonts
Self explanatory, changes Font sizes.<br>
<br>
`Butttos`: Tags, File Stab, Scale/Arp buttons, MIDI Learn Knobs/Buttons, and probably more stuff<br>
`Labels`: Preset result list, main MIDI learn button, and probably more stuff<br>
I'll any consider suggestions to change other font sizes.<br>

- Note - Incresing the font too much without also increasing the deault height the GUI window can result in not being able to have both Types and Character expanded at the same time in the Browser<br>

## Wide Browser
A colletion of several small mods that makes the browser wider enought to allow 4 rows of product thumbnails instead of 3. (Thanks Pete96 for sharing the details of patch)
