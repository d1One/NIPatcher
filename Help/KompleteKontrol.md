# Komple Kontrol patches:

## Window Size

Self explanatory, changes the window size.<br>
<br>
With Plugin: Changes the height of the KK window when there is a Plugin loaded.<br>
No Plugin: Changes the height of the KK window when there no a Plugin loaded, if this value is bigger than "With Plugin" then the window will always use the value set here. I recommend setting both to the same size.<br>


## Fonts

Self explanatory, changes Font sizes.<br>
<br>
Butttos: Tags, File Stab, Scale/Arp buttons, MIDI Learn Knobs/Buttons, +<br>
Labels: Preset result list, main MIDI learn button, +<br>
Note Inscreasing the font too much without also increasing the height of the KK window can result in not being able to have both Types and Character expanded at the same time<br>

## Wide Browser
A colletion of several small mods that makes the browser wider enought to allow rows of 4 product thumbnails.
