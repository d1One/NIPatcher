# NIPatcher
Patcher to apply modifications to Native Instruments Maschine and Komplete Kontrol software, **only supporting Maschine for now.**

Tested with Maschine v2.17 only!

MacOS compatibility:
- Native Apple Silicon support.
- macOS 13 Ventura.
- macOS 12 Monterey.
- macOS 11 Big Sur.

I might add older versions later depending on users engagement.

# Features
## GUI / Interface
- [x] Change the default GUI window sizes.
- [x] Change GUI window minimum size (Plugins)
- [x] Change Font sizes.

## Hardware
- [x] MK3, Mikro Mk3 & M+ - Stop button Double tap.
- [x] JAM - Change patterns without changing focus.

# How to use NIPatcher:
The first time runing the app requires a righ-click and selecting `Open`, MacOS will tell you it can't verify the app, thats normal since I really dont want to pay no $100 for the Apple developer certification.

* 1 - Press `Copy` button, this will copy all your Maschine Plugins + the Maschine app to a new folder on your Desktop called NIPatcher, it will also create shortcuts to your App and Plugin locations.<br>
* 2 - Select the modifications you want and whether you want them to be applied Maschine 2.app, your plugins or both.<br>
* 3 - Press `Patch` and the modifications will be applied to all files in the NIPatcher folder on the Desktop.<br>
* 4 - (Optional) Press `Codesign` - this is mostly only required for Ableton Live users.<br>
* 5 - Open the NIPatcher folder on your Desktop and simply move each modified file into its respective shortcut and confirm you want to overwrite the unmodified version.<br>

If you don't codesign in Step #4 MacOS will think the app is damaged, if that happens simply right-click it and select `Open`.

#### Why so many steps?
<details>
  <summary>1 Copy</summary>
Due to Apple's security features writing into `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins` or `/Library/Application Support/Avid/Audio/Plug-Ins` requires either the user to be prompted for the folders or for me to make an external helper tool (like the one Native Access has). This is way above my current very low skillset so instead of directly modifying the files they are copied to the desktop first, this might not be ideal but gives the user a chance to check if everything is working on the App copy for example.<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>4 Codesign</summary>
Codesign is also required due to Security stuff, since we modify the Plugins and/or application and some DAW's like Ableton Live check for this we need to codesign it s Ableton Live can sleep well at night and not be scared.<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>5 Manually moving patched files</summary>
Moving the files thru the shortcuts is the fastest way I was able to make it work without bothering the user too much, this way it's the MacOS Finder who asks you for permissions when moving the modified files to the Plugins/Application locations.<br>

## Why even make NIPatcher?
To make some improvements to the software since feature requests seem to not achieve anything. Making modifications manually is annoying and hard for the average user, by having an app dedicated to it perhaps more users will be willing to contribute with more modifications and this project can grow.

# Discription of the modifications:
## Window Size:
![Window Size Explanation](https://github.com/d1One/NIPatcher/blob/main/Images/Window_Size.png?raw=true)
Changes the default view presets under the Maschine Dropdown > View.
These mods are mostly usefull for the Plugins since their window size is fixed, you can for example:
- Change the one of preset sizes to make sure Maschine-Plugin fills your whole screen, usefull for people with 2 monitors for example since MAS-PLug has no Full-Screen option, only the MAS-App does.
- Minimum height can be used if for some reason you want to be able to make the Maschine App window very small and only see your Scene, Sections / Song View.
- In the future I'll add more complicated mods like making the browser wider for example.

## Font Size:
This modification exists mainly because the browser has a tiny font + the fact that it's blurry/pixelated due to Maschine not having Hi-Res/Retina support.
- Button size affects: Tags in the Browser, Pad Names, Pattern names in Ideas view and many other things.
- Label size affets: Mainly the Browser Preset list (But probably many other things too)

As users share results I'll make a more detailed description of font sizes and possibly add more things to costumize.

Here is an example of both Buttons and Labels with a fontsize of 15 VS the original value of 11:
![Label and Font 15 compared to original Maschine](https://github.com/d1One/NIPatcher/blob/main/Images/Labels%2015.png)

## Stop Button:
TL;DR: This mod makes the `Stop` button return the Playhead to the beguining if the project is not playing, basically this means we can get the same beahvior as most DAW's have: double press `Stop` to return to the beguining.

Longer explanation: The Maschine Mk3 introduced a `Stop` button on the HW, prior models did not have this, this was great but the Software never changed. If you look at Maschine's top menu Transport section there is no Stop. So as far as the softare is concerned `Stop` and `Play` **behave exactly the same way when the project is playing**, it makes no difference if you press `Play` again or `Stop`, they both do the same and thus the `Stop` button is completely redundant in this scenario... So, my mod makes `Stop` restart and stop really fast only when the project is playing which results in leaving the playhead in the beginning without affecting the normal Stop behavior. Best of both worlds! ðŸŽ‰

This is not available for the MAS-Plugin because it does not have access to the transport, the Host/DAW does.

## Jam Focus:
(untested)
Changing Patterns with Jam causes Maschine to lose focus on whatever Group you have active if the Pattern yoou changed is in another Group, often this can be undesirable, this mod changes that. This was shared by maschuser1 on the Maschine Forum [here](https://community.native-instruments.com/discussion/5072/tip-changing-patterns-on-the-maschine-jam-without-changing-focus), all credit goes to him/her.
I dont have a Jam to test this so let me know how it works!

## Info Tab
For now this tab is just experimental, it just checks if all the plugins and application is at the expected paths by NIPatcher.

# If you want to contribute:
As of now I am just a newbie with this stuff, I'm not a real developer so until I'm more familiar with github pull requests wont be a thing, I also need the app tested by some users to know it's good, rewrite lots of the code to make it more readable etc... Then I'll put it fully on github as open-source.

So for now anyone that wants to contribute can just right click the Maschine 2.app, select show package contents, mess around and report anything usefull. If I am not a dev and found soe stuff, so can you! :)
